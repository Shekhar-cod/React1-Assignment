<!--Using create-react-app, create a new React project. 
Create a LoginForm component that contains the following:
Username and password input fields, an h3 that says Log In, with a border. 
Style the component using the default generated CSS file.
Create a Navigation component that contains links styled like a navbar.
The links don't have to go anywhere.
Put the Navigation component at the top of the page and 
the LoginForm in the center of the page.
